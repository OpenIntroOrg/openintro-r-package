Description: Supplemental functions and data for 'OpenIntro' resources, which 
    includes open-source textbooks and resources for introductory statistics 
    (<https://www.openintro.org/>). The package contains data sets used in our 
    open-source textbooks along with custom plotting functions for reproducing 
    book figures. Note that many functions and examples include color 
    transparency; some plotting elements may not show up properly (or at all) 
    when run in some versions of Windows operating system.
